                                    <li>The primary role of attackers is to create and capitalize on scoring opportunities by shooting accurately and powerfully to get the ball past the goalkeeper.</li>
                                    <li>Attackers work together to set up offensive plays, using their positioning, quick passes, and strategic movement to disrupt the defense and create open spaces for shots.</li>
                                    <li>Attackers often use dodges and quick directional changes to evade defenders, positioning themselves closer to the goal or setting up other teammates for successful shots.</li>
                                    <li>By maintaining an aggressive and skillful approach near the goal, attackers can draw fouls from defenders, often resulting in free-position shots for high-percentage scoring chances.</li>
                                    <li>Attackers apply pressure by maintaining possession and controlling the tempo of the game, preventing turnovers and forcing defenders to stay on high alert, which can tire out the opposition.</li>

                                    <li>Midfielders play a key role in moving the ball from defense to offense and vice versa, providing a crucial link across the field.</li>
                                    <li>Midfielders often take the draw after each goal, aiming to gain initial possession and give their team the advantage.</li>
                                    <li>Midfielders contribute to both attacking and defensive plays, assisting in scoring opportunities and helping to prevent opponent goals.</li>
                                    <li>Midfielders focus on maintaining possession during transitions and clearing the ball safely out of the defensive end, reducing turnovers.</li>
                                    <li>Given their role across the full field, midfielders need high endurance to constantly support plays on both ends, often leading in ground balls and overall field coverage.</li>

                                    <li>The primary role of defenders is to stop attackers from scoring by blocking shooting lanes, marking opponents closely, and intercepting passes near the goal.</li>
                                    <li>Defenders stay closely matched with attackers, using positioning and physical pressure to disrupt offensive plays and limit their opponents' scoring opportunities.</li>
                                    <li>Defenders use legal stick checks to dislodge the ball from attackers, aiming to create turnovers and regain possession for their team.</li>
                                    <li>Defenders constantly communicate with teammates to coordinate their movements, set up double-teams, and adjust to offensive plays, ensuring a cohesive defensive strategy.</li>
                                    <li>Once defenders gain possession, they play a critical role in transitioning the ball from the defensive zone to the midfield or attacking players, setting up the offense and maintaining game momentum.</li>

                                    <li>Goalkeepers have a clear view of the field and communicate with defenders, calling out threats, marking assignments, and coordinating defensive positioning to counter offensive plays.</li>
                                    <li>After making a save, goalkeepers initiate the transition to offense by accurately passing or clearing the ball to defenders or midfielders, setting up their team’s attack.</li>
                                    <li>Goalkeepers are responsible for controlling the crease, positioning themselves effectively to cut down shooting angles and limit scoring opportunities for attackers.</li>
                                    <li>Goalkeepers play a critical mental role, staying composed under pressure, rebounding quickly after goals, and providing a sense of stability and confidence for the defense.</li>

                    <!-- lists of minor and major fouls in lacrosse -->
                    <p>The game is played with 10 players on each team, with positions divided between attackers, midfielders, and defenders. Players use a lacrosse stick to pass, carry, and shooting by throwing the ball into the opponent’s goal. Fouls are penalized and split into two main categories: major and minor fouls.</p>
                    <p>The penalties for major fouls result in the opposing player being awarded an 8-meter free position shot or free movement positioning. The offending player must move four meters behind or to the side of the fouled player.</p>
                    <p>The penalties for minor fouls results in the opponent is usually awarded an indirect free position at the spot of the foul, meaning the player cannot shoot directly on goal but must pass first. The offending player stands four meters away.</p>
                    <h4>Major fouls:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excessive force, especially near the head or body.</li>

                        <li>Propelling the ball dangerously near another player.</li>
                        <li>Allowing the stick to dangerously follow through after a shot or pass.</li>
                        <li>Impeding an opponent's movement without attempting to play the ball.</li>
                        <li>Causing an opponent to trip by obstructing their path with a stick or foot.</li>
                        <li>Using a stick or body to hold or impede an opponent’s movement.</li>

                        <li>Using a stick that doesn’t meet regulations or improper player equipment.</li>
                        <li>Intentionally using a body part to play the ball (outside of the goalkeeper’s crease).</li>
                        <li>Entering or reaching into the goal circle if you are not the goalkeeper.</li>
                        <li>Substituting improperly, such as not following substitution procedures.</li>
